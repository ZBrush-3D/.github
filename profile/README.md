## About ZBrush

ZBrush by Pixologic (Maxon) is the **gold standard for 3D sculpting and modeling**. It gives artists the ability to carve, mold, and texture virtual clay with the same fluidity as working by hand — but with digital precision.  

Its revolutionary **Dynamesh and ZRemesher** technologies allow unlimited creativity without worrying about polygon constraints. Sculpt intricate details, merge complex meshes, and refine forms dynamically.  

The painting tools enable direct color application on 3D models, with full support for **PBR texturing** and material layering. Combined with ZBrush’s powerful rendering engine, artists can visualize concepts and production-ready assets in one environment.  

Used by **leading studios in film, gaming, and concept art**, ZBrush is the professional’s choice for pushing creative boundaries in digital sculpture.
